# wav2lipTest

## To run the model
Upload the [notebook](https://github.com/johntharian/wav2lipTest/blob/main/Wav2lip.ipynb) to google Collab or open this [collab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1IS_8oy1bzj0Y3N4il1uzE5CMTngOuHFv?usp=sharing)and run the cells sequentially

The video explaining the code is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UGQRzzEM_T_XZr0Asin9e6If38ue39K2/view)

There were a total of 4 videos generated among which [normal_compressed_without.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kM2dB7jN4Eec462tAe-XzP8ONeAeMNjJ/view?usp=drive_link) provided the best results, although the video resolution has been reduced.

The input video file for the best video was compressed to reduce resolution.

[noraml_without.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jo4adDpvLsbOz1ua59Vlvvshcs3FnTty/view?usp=sharing) has good lip syncing without compression.

1. [opfinal.mp4](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NLTP262NFf6SozCmtbcp4erZq-ziwPjN/view?usp=drive_link) (trimmed) - HD
